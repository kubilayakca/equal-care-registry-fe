                posology: "The recommended dose is 100 mg of eptinezumab administered by intravenous infusion every 12 weeks; some patients may benefit from 300 mg IV every 12 weeks. Treatment should be prescribed and supervised by clinicians experienced in migraine, with re-evaluation of the need for continued therapy if response is insufficient or after 12 months, as data beyond 12 months are limited. In case of a missed dose, the next dose should be given as soon as possible and the 12‑weekly schedule continued. Eptinezumab is for intravenous infusion only after dilution into 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, using an in-line filter, and the infusion should be administered over approximately 30 minutes; it must not be given as a bolus injection. No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients or in those with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. Vyepti should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this age group.",

For breastfeeding, no data exist on excretion of eptinezumab in human milk or effects on the infant, but human IgG is excreted in breast milk and eptinezumab may be transmitted to the breastfed infant, so a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue Vyepti, weighing the benefits for the mother and child.",
